Presently, he saw an open space and the green leaves of the edge of the thicket . A smallish savage was standing between him and the rest of the forest, a savage striped red and white, and carrying a spear. He was coughing, and smearing the paint about his eyes with the back of his hand as he tried to see through the increasing smoke.<br/>\n<br/>\n<u>Ralph launched himself like a cat:</u> stabbed, snarling, with the spear, and the savage doubled up. There was a shout from beyond the thicket and then Ralph was running with the swiftness of fear through the undergrowth.

He passed his tongue tentatively over his teeth and lips and heard far off the ululation of the pursuers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe literary device used in ''Ralph launched himself like a cat'' is",

Three months ago, Atongo and Agbenya said they were leaving town because \"things have become too hard.\" as they put it. They asked Mark to come along. He declined saying that he would have to prepare. Of course, he simply could not go-dare not. He had a pact with Akwele who sells kenkey downtown: neither could leave town without the other. At the time Mark's friends were ready, Akwele had travelled to Accra and would, unknown to anyone, <ins>not return in a hurry</ins>. This is why Mark is lying dejected on his bed, a hungry man.
