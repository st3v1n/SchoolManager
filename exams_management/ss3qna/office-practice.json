The vision of the Managing Director, Dr. Rock Bansco was that the Company would become the leading supplier of office machines. He also hoped that the company would provide employment for many secondary school leavers.<br/>\r\nWithin the first five years of the company's inception, its profit grew rapidly. The customers increased so much that by the sixth year of the company's operation, the staff strength had become more than one hundred. However, all the workers who were employed in its sixth year of operation were both unqualified and inexperienced, worse still, they were given supervisory positions because of their relationship to the Managing Director in one way or the other.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs a large company, OKF Limited had six Heads of Department. However, the Managing Director hardly involved any of them in the day-to-day running of the company. He did all recruitment, purchases as well as salaries and wages administration. Staff salaries and wages were also very poor. As time went on, virtually all the staff became unhappy and this affected their morale.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Managing Director recently called an emergency meeting to address the staff, surprisingly, he did not appoint anyone to record the proceedings of the meeting.<br/>\r\n\u00a0</p>\n<p>a) State <strong>two</strong> problems in OKF Limited.</p>\n<p>b)\u00a0Outline departments in OKF Limited that should be responsible for the following activities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>recruitment of workers</li>\n<li>sales promotion</li>\n<li>acquisition of machines</li>\n<li>payments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>c) i) When is an emergency meeting called by the management of an organisation?</p>\n<p>ii)\u00a0What is the meeting's related title of the officer who should have recorded the meeting proceedings?</p>\n<p>iii)\u00a0State two duties the officer in (c)(ii) should have carried out before the day of the meeting</p>\n<p>iv)\u00a0List five headings under which the officer would have recorded the proceedings of the meeting.</p>",

They came late to work and left before the closing time. As a result of this, the volume of production of the company reduced. This inturn, reduced the income of the organization so much that payments of workers' wages and salaries became difficult. Many experienced workers began to leave the firm for greener pastures.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe firm also found it difficult to meet its financial obligations to suppliers. On assumption of duty, Mr. Okonkwo quickly swung into action. He carried out an investigation to ascertain the causes of these problems. One of his findings was that workers bitterly complained about their conditions of service. Although their wages and salaries were acceptable, they asked for other benefits from the company which were denied them<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMr. Okonkwo also discovered that workers were employed without following due process. Finally, he found out that no measure was put in place to regulate the punctuality of workers. Armed with these finding, Mr Okonkwo addressed each of the issues and put in place adequate measures to ensure proper supervision and satisfaction of workers.</p>\n<p><br/>\r\n(a).\u00a0Suggest one measure that Mr. Okonkwo could use to improve staff regularity at work</p>\n<p>(b).\u00a0\u00a0Apart from irregularity at work, state two other problems in Theolas International Company</p>\n<p>(c).\u00a0List six welfare packages that would improve workers satisfaction at Theolas International Company</p>\n<p>(d).\u00a0State four pre-employment activities the company should have carried out in recruiting its staff</p>",
